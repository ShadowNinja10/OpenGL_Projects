OpenGL Triangles:
In this program I could produce 3 connected triangles with only 6 vertices using Index buffering .
I used online source code for vertex shader and fragment shader and given different colors to different vertices.
Created seaparated header and cpp files for more clean code. 
After running main.cpp we get result of 3 connected triangles with different shades using shaders in opengl

OpenGL 3D pyramid:
In this program first I created texture from online png file and seaparated them by creating their on header and cpp files.
Using five coordinates and then assigning them color and their texture coordinates Created 3D pyramid with texture.
Using function like rotation and adding specific radians per second we get rotation of pyramid.
After running main.cpp we get result of textured pyramid wiith rotation.
